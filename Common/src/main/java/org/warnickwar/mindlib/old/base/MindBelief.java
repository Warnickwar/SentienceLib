/**
 * <p>
 *     A MindBelief represents an {@link MindAgent Agent's} beliefs, or thoughts, about their environment.
 *     This is used by {@link MindGoal goals} to dictate which goals should be prioritized, or done.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     Evaluating {@code true} means that this belief, and all its conditions, are satisfied.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     Evaluating {@code false} means that this belief is not satisfied, and something is wrong.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     Beliefs can be chained together with {@link MindSensor Sensors} to detect conditions about the
 *     environment, and evaluate conditions which indicate things about the state of the world or agent.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     Beliefs can also, optionally, supply an {@link Vec3} as a {@code Location} to be used by actions. By default,
 *     the Belief will supply a location of {@link Constants#NULL_LOCATION}, which indicates a location
 *     that is not set. This is different from a position of {@code (0,0,0)}, as to avoid collisions with (0,0,0) in the
 *     actual world.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     By default, Beliefs will return a conditional of {@code true} (always satisfied), and
 *     a location of {@link Constants#NULL_LOCATION} (no or invalid location) unless otherwise set.
 * </p>
